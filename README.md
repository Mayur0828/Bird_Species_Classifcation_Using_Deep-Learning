# Bird_Species_Classification_using_Deep Learning


Here I am using Different Deep Learning Models to implement Image classification:

The models being used are:

1) Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
2) VGG16
3) RestNet101
   
Here, I am using VGG16 Pretrained Model which is a standard model provided by CNN.
