# Bird_Species_Classification_using_Deep Learning


Here I am using Different Deep Learning Models to implement Image classification:

The models being used are:

1) Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
2) Recurrence Neural Network(RNN)
   

   Here, I am using VGG16 Pretrained Model which is a standard model provided by CNN.


And For Visual Representation, I am using Streamlit Frameworkin python
